#ACM Design

###Goal:
The Goal of ACM DESIGN is to help organize the front-end design of our ACM website. This includes:
1. Frameworks/Tools
2. Color Scheme
3. Typography
4. Branding

###1. Frameworks
Styling for the website is currently done using Twitter Bootstrap's Framework (v3.3.5). If you are not sure how to use this framework, you can check out their documentation here: http://getbootstrap.com 

We use bootstrap to quickly develop a mobile friendly website and later override with our own custom css.

###2. Color Scheme
```css
    orange: #FF9268;
    turquoise: #63C7B2;
    darkBlue: #384A58;
```

###3. Typography
We use a google hosted font called 'Open Sans' located here: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans
We use 2 font weights: normal(400) and bold(700)

Quick Use:
```html
    <!-- html -->
    <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```

```css
    /* css */
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-weight: 700;
```

###4. Branding
