    <h4>As the O'ahu Student Chapter, our sole aim is to provide members with valuable connections, a creative collaborative startup environment, resources for the construction of a desirable entrepreneurial project, ultimately making members more desirable to employers in a competitive work environment.</h4>
    <h4>ACM at Manoa is first and foremost incredibly desired by the students of the ICS department, having an astounding 40+ member turnout at the first meeting and growing past 55+ this week. It is designed to do everything a student-run organization should, but in ways no other organization ever has. It will keep students closely connected to the department, while still providing the students room to experiment and take their ideas further than they ever dreamt possible. So in addition to creating a highly motivated student body, ACM will promote a thriving Computer Science Department with great developers and thinkers for the future of technology.</h4>
    <h4>ACM at Manoa's goal is to make powerful technology more accessible to the students, create amazing projects that are more relevant to the studentsâ€™ interests, and ultimately make the students more desirable to future employers. ACM at Manoa will represent a new chapter in the relationship the student will have with the department. It is the most progressive movement the department has ever made because it is the first one designed by students for the students.</h4>
    <h4>ACM at Manoa will hold events that promote professional, social, and developmental experiences throughout the term that will further the department and its students.</h4>
